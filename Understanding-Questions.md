# Understanding Questions:
1. What are the steps of execution from the pressing of the 1 button to the rendering of our updated value? List what part of the code excutes for each step.
* The user presses the 1 button.
* 
<!-- ...When the 1 button on the browser is pressed, the onClick handler is triggered.
The handler dispatches the AddOne action function which in turn returns the ADD_ONE type.
This action is what is passed through the reducer where the ADD_ONE type is defined as a case and returns in this case the current state total + 1 -->

* TotalDisplay shows the total plus 1.
